                        <p>Honestly, it seems rather typical for a young teen enjoy gaming. But being such a great pass time it can be understood why. Plus there are a good few benefits to this hobby besides entertainment. For one, first person shooter games can improve reaction timing, which is useful outside games. It can also help with education through moral decisions and physics elements within the game.<br>And despite the downsides to gaming, I enjoy it a lot and rely on it to keep me busy.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>I have a small habit of thinking about things, how they could be used, and what they could be made into. In fact, I’m part of a fandom community that has an interest in anthropomorphic animals, the furry community. And one activity that’s common in the community is fursuiting, an activity that involves wearing an animalistic suit of an original anthropomorphic character. Wearing a full-body suit can get rather warm. And though you can get small DC fans installed into the head to help, ventilation and cooling are an issue with them. So as I thought about it, I thought about the use of compact DC air pumps that can be brought for fish tanks when AC is unavailable. I thought about the use of those styles of pumps being used to force outside air into the suits and, even if it’s not much, improve cooling and ventilation for the suits.</p>
                        <p>And even if it leads me to ramble on, even when writing (which is a unique talent if I say so myself), it could come to be a useful habit. A habit that has use in everyday life and the workplace.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>A vital part of technology nowadays and the core to all software and websites, coding is a useful thing. And not only is it the reason this portfolio exists, but can also be entertaining (to me at least). Sometimes I wanna be creative, and without many skills in music or art, using the power of code is all I have left. I’ll occasionally just start making basic websites for any old reason, to pass the time and keep me busy.<br>Though with the right job, and/or reason, my slowly expanding skills in coding could turn out to be helpful in future work opportunities.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>Much like art, music can be a rather versatile skill. Helpful when making things like animations, games. Though I tend only to listen to it. I have tried to learn to play the acoustic guitar when I was younger, however.</p>
                        <p>But even when you’re not the one making it, music is a good way to pass the time, or maybe make a durry day a little more entertaining. It can also be seen as a way to make others feel emotions, or pass out messages to others (either personal, or general).</p>
                        <p>But in the end, I like to listen to it, to both keep me entertained and relax myself when I need a mental break from the world around me.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>It might just be my sweet tooth, but I’ve always had an interest in cooking food. Probably as it’s an edible art form. And could help improve your mood in different ways with the correct flavor. Plus, in the long term, could be seen as a valuable skill.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>An extremely versatile talent to have, art has been an interest for a while now. I even brought a graphics pad. And although learning on my own is taking a while, once I’ve figured it all out I’ll have the ability to create graphics for all kinds of personal or work projects. So it’s an interest that will turn out to be useful to learn.</p>
                        <p>Another plus is the ability to express opinions, emotions, and interests visually.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>With a rather creative mind, it only makes sense that crafts & building take my interest. In other words, the idea of being able to express my creativity through physical objects I’ve made intrigues me. Plus it means I’d have to spend less on buying things premade, and only buy the materials necessary to make my own. Guess it’s also helpful when it comes to decorating a house. Or just playing with ideas to pass the time, and maybe come out with something unique.</p>

                    <div class="reason-two">
                        <p>This interest branches from a few others, like my interest in art and crafts. And I understand why. With technology nowadays, you can create revolutionary things. Or simply create tools for you to make everyday life easier. But no matter the reason, tech is just a great thing to create stuff with. And it definitely sparks my mind to think of uses and ideas for things I could (learn to) make. Plus with the constant development of technologies, the possibilities seem endless.</p>
