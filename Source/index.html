                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website.</p>
                <p>Here you'll be able to find information on me. Such as hobbies and experience.</p>
                <p>You'll also find my work history here as well.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Named Orion, aged 16 (Since the year 2020), I’m currently a student in the college known as The College of West Anglia. In my current stage of education, I am studying the subject of IT, a subject I’ve been interested in for a while now.</p>
                <p>In person, typically, I’m rather quiet, being observant rather than social. Though, at times, I can also be rather sociable. But that’s typically only with people I’ve been around enough to be comfortable with. Despite this antisocial and isolatory behaviour, I can work with others, although personally prefer to work alone, still reaching out to others when in need of assistance, however. I mention this here as it’s a large factor to whether or not others see me as an asset rather than a hindrance.</p>
